<!-- The Number Man

Haru had a strange superpower. He could get the number of anything he wanted, just by thinking about it. He could know the number of times a person had drank coffee in their life, or the number of times they had nearly missed death. He could know the number of stars in the sky, or the number of grains of sand on the beach. He could know the number of secrets in the world, or the number of lies he had told.

He didn't know how he got this power, or why. He just knew that it was there, ever since he was a child. He used to amuse himself by counting things that no one else could count. He would impress his friends by guessing their phone numbers, or their birthdays, or their crushes. He would win bets by predicting the outcomes of games, or races, or elections. He would ace exams by knowing the answers to every question.

But as he grew older, he realized that his power was not always a blessing. Sometimes, it was a curse. He learned that some numbers were better left unknown. He learned that some numbers could hurt him, or others. He learned that some numbers could change his life, or end it.

He learned this the hard way, when he met Shreya.

Shreya was a beautiful girl who worked at his office. Haru liked her from the first day he saw her. She had a smile that lit up the room, and a voice that sounded like music. She was smart, and funny, and kind. Haru wanted to know everything about her.

So he used his power.

He learned that she had drank coffee 3,456 times in her life. He learned that she had nearly missed death 12 times. He learned that she had 7 secrets, and 4 lies. He learned that she had 2 ex-boyfriends, and 1 current crush.

He learned that her crush was him.

He was overjoyed. He couldn't believe his luck. He decided to ask her out. He thought she would say yes.

But she didn't.

She said no.

She said she was sorry.

She said she liked him as a friend.

She said she had a reason.

She said she had a number.

She said she had cancer.

She said she had 6 months to live.

Haru was stunned. He didn't know what to say. He didn't know what to do. He felt a surge of emotions: shock, sadness, anger, denial, guilt.

He wished he didn't know.

He wished he never used his power.

He wished he never met her.

But it was too late.

He knew.

And he couldn't forget.

He couldn't forget her number.

6 months.

182 days.

4,368 hours.

262,080 minutes.

15,724,800 seconds.

And counting down. -->
